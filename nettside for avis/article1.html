        <p>In this day and age, every single person has a smartphone. Its use has expanded from communication to digital media platforms where you can scroll through photos, watch videos, and share your own.</p>
        <p>In recent years, its use has grown excessively among people, to the point in which it has affected their mental health, including sleep disruption, and insomnia. Mental illness has increased, mostly among teenagers and young adults, affecting their ability to perform in their daily lives and have normal sleeping schedules, and further affecting other aspects of their health.</p>
        <p>According to a report made by Folkehelseinstituttet, sleep dysfunctions have grown to 38% in women and 26% in men, and among students combined 34%. (Folkehelseinstituttet, 2023)</p>

        <p>Lisa, 17, serves as an example of that.
     As a student in high school, the seventeen-year-old uses a smartphone daily to communicate with friends and scroll through social media.
     The time used on the phone stretches to several hours, and before he realizes it, it is past midnight.
     Her sleep schedule is short, and within some hours she has to wake up for the next day.
     But due to the stimuli that the bright screen,
    the scrolling and chatting from the phone brought to her brain, Lisa found herself unable to get a good night's sleep.</p>

      <p>These sleepless nights stretched for days, and Lisa’s sleep and productivity decreased noticeably.
          Her grades started to fall. Her appearance turned unwell. Her mood tended to be worse. </p>
      
     <p>The teachers noticed the shift in their student’s performance and appearance.
     They pointed it out to Lisa, advising her to take her sleep seriously, and to her parents as well.
      It bothered Lisa enough to take a grip on herself and prioritize her sleep dysfunction, also called insomnia.
