    <h1 class="art3-headline">Youth and Energy Drinks: A Growing Concern</h1>

        <article class="art3">
            <p>
                These days, it's common to see teenagers carrying energy drinks, sometimes instead of having a proper meal, or as a quick way to get energy to get through their day.
                In fact, if you were to look around classrooms, the most likely object on a student's desk might be a can of energy drink.
                For many, it has become a go-to item to boost focus and performance, especially during study sessions.

            <p>But while these drinks are marketed as productivity boosters, experts warn that their overconsumption could lead to serious health issues down the line.</p>


            <p> Recent reports raise a troubling question: Are students becoming overly dependent on energy drinks because of the intense academic pressures they face?
             Have these beverages replaced coffee as the go-to source of caffeine for the younger generation?
             And what about the companies behind these drinks—are they profiting from the stress and pressure that young people experience in school and work environments?</p>

        <p> Energy drinks have become increasingly popular among young people, particularly kids and teens. Many consume them to stay awake, improve focus, or simply for their taste.
            However, this growing trend has raised alarms due to the potential health risks associated with high caffeine and sugar intake.</p>
        <p> According to a 2023 survey by the Norwegian National Institute of Public Health <a href="https://www.fhi.no/nyheter/2023/mange-norske-ungdommer-drikker-mye-energidrikk/" class="plain-link"> (FHI) </a> 58% of middle school students and 72% of high school students reported drinking energy drinks regularly​.
            What’s more concerning is that one-third of these students consume three or more cans in a single day.</p>

        <p>The infographic above highlights these alarming statistics, showing the percentage of middle and high school students who report drinking energy drinks.
                 The data comes from the Ungdata survey, which took place between 2017 and 2022, with over 300,000 students participating</p>

        <p>Experts warn that the high caffeine content in energy drinks can lead to sleep disturbances, anxiety, and strain on both the heart and nervous system.
            This trend raises critical questions about the long-term impact on youth health and whether energy drinks are truly a sustainable solution to the pressures that students face.</p>
